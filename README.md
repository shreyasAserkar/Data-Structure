This adaptive algorithm sorts the inputs of users in the format "Firstname Lastname|Address|City|State|ZipCode" and applies the best algortihm by switching in between the running time to yield out the best time complexity of the sorting algorithm.
To sort the Data the following sortings are implemented and are interswitched during run-time if the time complexity increases inorder to output the sorting with best time complexity:
1. Radix Sort
2. Djikshtra
3. customSort

The input to the program is is checked on various sizes of data and the time complexity is analyzed on each of them.The input varies from 10 to 4000.
